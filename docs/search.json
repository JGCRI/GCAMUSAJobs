Currently, GCAM-USA calculate power sector jobs. GCAMUSAJobs extends GCAM-USA functionality (1) estimating power plant capacity levels different activities – operational capacity, capacity addition, retirement; (2) calculating jobs associated activities, including jobs operation maintenance (O&M), construction, decommissioning. Workflow GCAMUSAJobs  GCAMUSAJobs utilizes GCAM-USA annual electricity generation outputs estimate underlying capacity levels based assumptions capacity factors calculate associated power sector jobs based employment factors. employment factor represents average number jobs created per unit power plant activity (e.g., jobs per gigawatt). method widely used relevant literature1,2. GCAMUSAJobs adopts employment factors NREL’s Jobs & Economic Development Impacts (JEDI) model, broadly used literature1,3,4. tool focuses estimating direct jobs power sector, meaning employment directly involved construction, operation, decommissioning power plants, opposed indirect induced jobs broader economy. functionality supports need assessing distributional labor impacts energy system transition.
